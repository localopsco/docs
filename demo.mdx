For your convenience, your LocalOps account comes with the following:

1. Sample App(s)

2. Sample Releases

3. Sandbox Cloud Connection

4. Default Environment template

Using these, you can start creating App Environments and explore all the core functionality.

<Info>
  Source code of each of the demo apps are available in our [Github organisation](https://github.com/localopsco).
</Info>

## Sample App[​](https://docs.localops.co/get-started/try-demo-app#sample-app "Direct link to Sample App")

Navigate to **Apps** section from the sidebar. You can see the Sample Python/Django app in this page.

This is a Python/Django application we built and packaged as Kubernetes Helm chart.

## Sample Releases[​](https://docs.localops.co/get-started/try-demo-app#sample-releases "Direct link to Sample Releases")

Navigate to **Releases** section from the sidebar. You can see there are multiple releases that you didn't create earlier. These belong to the sample Python/Django app.

## Sandbox cloud connection[​](https://docs.localops.co/get-started/try-demo-app#sandbox-cloud-connection "Direct link to Sandbox cloud connection")

Navigate to **Connections** section from the sidebar. You can see there is a cloud connection available that you didn't create either. This belongs to LocalOps and points at LocalOps's own AWS account.

Instead of adding your own cloud connection, you can use this connection to spin up App environments and explore functionalities quickly.
