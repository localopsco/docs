For your convenience, your LocalOps account comes with the following:

1. Sample App(s)
2. Sample Releases
3. Sandbox Cloud Connection
4. Default Environment template

Using these, you can start creating App Environments and explore all the core functionality.

<Note>
  Source code of each of the demo apps are available in our [Github
  organisation](https://github.com/localopsco).
</Note>

### Sample App

Navigate to **Apps** section from the sidebar. You can see the Sample Python/Django app in this page.

This is a Python/Django application we built and packaged as Kubernetes Helm chart.

### Sample Releases

Navigate to **Releases** section from the sidebar. You can see there are multiple releases that you didn't create earlier. These belong to the sample Python/Django app.

### Sandbox cloud connection

Navigate to **Connections** section from the sidebar. You can see there is a cloud connection available that you didn't create either. This belongs to LocalOps and points at LocalOps's own AWS account.

Instead of adding your own cloud connection, you can use this connection to spin up App environments and explore functionalities quickly.

### Default Environment template

Navigate to **Environment templates** from the sidebar. You can see there is a Default template available that you didn't create earlier. This environment template creates infrastructuree that works for most software cloud deliveries on AWS.

## Creating first App environment

1. Navigate to App environments
2. Click on "Create App environment"
3. Pick "Private Delivery" as Environment type
4. Provide a name like "My First Env"
5. Pick the "Default" environment template
6. Pick the Sample app as app to be deployed
7. Pick any version as App version
8. Pick "AWS Sandbox account"
9. Pick "Frankfurt, Germany" as Cloud region
10. Click "Next: Review environment"
11. Click "Looks good. Create app environment" in next step after reviewing environment details.

ðŸŽ‰ Your first app environment is now provisioned in "AWS Sandbox account".

As you can see, you can deploy any application to any cloud and region this way.
