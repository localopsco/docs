title: Multiple Helm Charts
---

In complex application environments, managing multiple Helm charts individually can become cumbersome.
Consolidating multiple Helm charts into a single Helm chart allows for easier management, deployment, and versioning of your application components. This guide outlines the steps to bring multiple Helm charts into an App Helm chart.

## Why Consolidate Helm Charts?

Bringing multiple Helm charts into a single App Helm chart offers several benefits:

- **Simplified Management**: Manage all application components (services, deployments, configurations) under one umbrella.
- **Improved Deployment**: Deploying a single Helm chart simplifies deployment workflows and ensures consistency.
- **Version Control**: Maintain version control for all components within the same repository or package.
- **Easier Collaboration**: Facilitates collaboration among team members working on different components of the application.

## Steps to Bring Multiple Helm Charts into an App Helm Chart

### 1. Understand Dependencies and Interactions

Before consolidating Helm charts, it's crucial to understand dependencies and interactions between different components of your application. Identify Helm charts for each component (e.g., frontend, backend, database) and their interdependencies.

### 2. Create a New App Helm Chart Structure

Start by creating a new directory structure for your App Helm chart. This directory will serve as the root directory containing subdirectories for each Helm chart you intend to include.

```plaintext
app-chart/
├── Chart.yaml        # Main Chart metadata
├── values.yaml       # Main Chart default values
├── charts/
│   ├── frontend/     # Subchart for frontend component
│   │   ├── Chart.yaml
│   │   ├── templates/
│   │   │   └── ...
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── backend/      # Subchart for backend component
│   │   ├── Chart.yaml
│   │   ├── templates/
│   │   │   └── ...
│   │   └── ...
│   └── database/     # Subchart for database component
│       ├── Chart.yaml
│       ├── templates/
│       │   └── ...
│       └── ...
└── ...
```

### 3. Include Subcharts in the Main Chart

Edit the `Chart.yaml` file of your main App Helm chart to define dependencies on each subchart (frontend, backend, database). Specify the versions and configurations required for each subchart.

```yaml app-chart/Chart.yaml
apiVersion: v2
name: app-chart
description: Main Helm chart for the entire application
version: 0.1.0
appVersion: '1.0'

dependencies:
  - name: frontend
    version: '1.0.0'
    repository: 'file://./charts/frontend'
  - name: backend
    version: '1.0.0'
    repository: 'file://./charts/backend'
  - name: database
    version: '1.0.0'
    repository: 'file://./charts/database'
```

### 4. Customize Values and Templates

Modify the `values.yaml` and templates within each subchart (`charts/frontend/values.yaml`, etc.) to align with your application's specific configuration requirements. Ensure that values and configurations are correctly propagated from the main chart to the subcharts.

### 5. Test and Deploy

Before deploying to production, test your consolidated Helm chart in a development or staging environment. Validate that all components deploy as expected and that configurations are applied correctly across all subcharts.

<Tip>
Update and Version Control

As you make updates to individual components (frontend, backend, database), update the corresponding subcharts within your main App Helm chart (`app-chart/charts/frontend`, etc.). Use version control to manage changes and track versions effectively.
