title: Cron Jobs
---

Cron jobs are used to run specific operations in your app based on a schedule.

You can define cron jobs within your Helm chart as a Kubernetes Job. Please use the following template and create a `cronjob.yaml` within your helm chart under `templates/` directory. Feel free to change image name and other details based on your app.

In essense, this definition will run a specific docker container on the specified cron schedule.

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: hello
spec:
  schedule: '*/10 * * * *' #Cron runs every 10mins
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: hello
              image: busybox:1.28
              imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
              command:
                - /bin/sh
                - -c
                - date; echo Hello from the Kubernetes cluster
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

- The schedule uses standard cron notation: `min hour day month day-of-week`.
- Ensure the container image you use contains the commands you want to run (in the example, we use busybox which includes basic shell commands).

Use `kubectl` to inspect whether your jobs are running as per schedule. To learn more, visit [Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/)

To use `kubectl` to inspect your app environment, see [How to use LocalOps CLI](/cli/usage).
