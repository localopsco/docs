title: VueJS
---

This documentation provides a step-by-step guide to prepare a Single Page Application (SPA) that was built using VueJS for deploying it in any cloud using LocalOps.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you will need the following:

- [Node.js][node], version 20.15.1 at the time of writing.
- [npm], as a package manager for installing and maintaining dependencies. This usually comes bundled with Node.js.
- A foundational knowledge of [Vue][vuejs].
- [Vite] for a dev server and building optimized static assets for production.
- [nginx] to serve static assets and also act as a reverse proxy server.
- [docker] to build standalone containers to serve your production app.

<Note>
  This guide assumes that you have basic knowledge of the above-mentioned
  technologies and tools. If you are not familiar with any of them, it is highly
  recommended to review their official documentation and tutorials to get up to
  speed before proceeding with this guide.
</Note>

## Scaffolding the Vue App

Vite offers a CLI tool that makes the scaffolding process much easier. Run the following command:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

Follow the prompts to create your first app. Refer to the [Vite guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) to learn more about scaffolding the app.

Once the application is ready, navigate to the directory and install all the dependencies:

```bash
cd vite-project # replace with the name of the project you created
npm install
```

After the dependencies are installed, you can start the dev server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This usually starts the server on port `5173`. Go to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to see your app.

The dev server is enabled with [HMR](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features#hot-module-replacement), so it hot reloads the application when you make changes.

## Building Your Production App

When it is time to deploy your app for production, simply run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command builds a highly optimized static bundle. By default, it uses `<root>/index.html` as the build entry point and produces an application bundle that is suitable to be served over a static hosting service. You can read more about [building for production in the Vite guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html#building-for-production).

The output is found in the `<root>/dist` directory unless configured to a different path.

<Tip>
  Once built, you can preview the production build using `npm run preview` to
  start a production-like local web server.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  It is important to note that `vite preview` is intended for previewing the
  build locally and not meant as a production server.
</Warning>

## Configuring nginx

Once the application is built for production, we need a static web server to serve those files. For that purpose, we are using [nginx], an open-source HTTP and reverse proxy server.

```nginx nginx.conf.template
server {
    listen ${PORT};
    server_name _;

    location / {
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

    # skip this block if you don't have a backend yet
    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://{BACKEND_HOST}:${BACKEND_PORT};
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
    location = /50x.html {
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    }
}
```

Create this file `nginx.conf.template` in the root of your project. We won't be using this template now; we'll use it to run the nginx server inside the Docker container.

Note two important blocks in this configuration:

```nginx
location / {
  root /usr/share/nginx/html;
  try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}
```

This block serves the `index.html` from the files we built using Vite, stored in the `/usr/share/nginx/html` folder. We will copy the assets to this folder while building the Docker application.

And then the API block:

```nginx
location /api/ {
    proxy_pass http://{BACKEND_HOST}:${BACKEND_PORT};
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
}
```

<Note>
  You might want to skip the API block if you don't have a backend yet;
  otherwise, nginx will throw an error for an invalid host on the backend URL.
</Note>

A typical non-static web application usually will have a backend, and we make AJAX requests using [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) or libraries like [axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) to get/send data to retrieve/store the application state.

Assume that the site we built is being served by nginx via the domain `example.com`. Whenever an API call is made to `example.com/api`, the nginx server acts as a reverse proxy server and forwards the request to the backend server.

You can use reverse proxying to navigate the traffic that is inbound to nginx. The reverse proxy server also acts as a mask, hiding the real backend from the outside world.

## Create the Docker Image

Dockerizing makes the app run anywhere, agnostic of the platform. As long as Docker is installed, whether it's Windows, Mac, or Linux, it can run with the same behavior.

Before creating the Dockerfile, let's create a `.dockerignore` file and add the contents that should not be copied over to the Docker file system.

```ignore .dockerignore
Dockerfile
.dockerignore
node_modules
npm-debug.log
README.md
.git
```

Read more about [.dockerignore here](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/context/#dockerignore-files).

<Important>
  Creating a `.dockerignore` file and adding folders like `node_modules` is a
  must, since dependencies will be installed while building the image based on
  the platform preferences used. Copying those from the file system will
  overwrite the installed dependencies and might cause errors during deployment.
</Important>

Now, create a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/). The Dockerfile is a text file that contains the instructions for Docker to build the image.

The Dockerfile is posted for reference with steps to create the production image. We leverage Docker's [Multi-Stage Builds](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/) to create a smaller-sized image for running the production server.

```docker Dockerfile
# Stage 1: Base
# This stage is the first stage
FROM node:20-alpine AS base

# Switch to the app directory,
# this will be our app's root directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the manifest and lock file to the root
# Note: ./ refers to /app, since we switched context in the above step
COPY package.json package-lock.json* ./

# Install the dependencies
RUN npm ci

# Set the NODE_ENV to production
# to configure the application to build/run under production mode
ENV NODE_ENV=production

# Copy all the files from our machine to the container
COPY . .

# Run the build to create production assets
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Production
# Now we build a new stage from scratch to run the nginx server
# This won't include any images from the previous steps
FROM nginx:alpine AS production

# The port you'd like to use for Nginx
ENV PORT=3000
# The URL for the backend service
ENV BACKEND_HOST=host.docker.internal
# Port for the backend
ENV BACKEND_PORT=3001

# Copy the template we created earlier for nginx to the etc folder
# note the destination file name should be default.conf.template
# else the variables in the config won't work
COPY nginx.conf.template /etc/nginx/templates/default.conf.template

# Since we started a new stage, we need to copy the build from the
# build step to the nginx's html directory. Note we have configured
# this directory in the nginx config file
COPY --from=base /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose the port the nginx is running to the outside world
EXPOSE ${PORT}

# Start the nginx server
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

Now you can build and run the Docker image. To build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t vue-app:latest .
```

This command builds the `vue-app` image for platform `linux/amd64` and tags it as `latest`.

If you are locally testing your application, you can skip the `platform` key to build the images

```bash
# only for testing in local machine
docker build -t vue-app:latest .
```

## Run the docker image

Let's run the Docker container using the image created for the Vue application with the command below.

```bash
docker run \
  -it \
  --rm \
  --name vue-app \
  -e PORT=3000 \
  -e BACKEND_PORT=3001 \
  -e BACKEND_HOST=host.docker.internal \
  -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  vue-app
```

- `-it`: Enables interactivity with TTY.
- `--rm`: Tells the Docker Daemon to clean up the container and remove the file system after the container exits.
- `--name vue-app`: Names the container `vue-app`.
- `-e PORT=3000`: Sets the environment variable PORT in Docker to `3000`.
- `-e BACKEND_PORT=3001`: Sets the environment variable BACKEND_PORT in Docker to `3001`.
- `-e BACKEND_HOST=host.docker.internal`: Sets the environment variable BACKEND_HOST in Docker to `host.docker.internal`.
- `-d`: Runs the container in detached (background) mode. You can skip this flag to see the logs directly in your terminal window.
- `-p 3000:3000`: Maps port 3000 on your host to port 3000 in the container.
- `vue-app`: The name of the image.

After running the command, visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the Vue application running inside the Docker container.

Hurray ðŸŽ‰. Now we have created and packaged a Vue app for production use.
