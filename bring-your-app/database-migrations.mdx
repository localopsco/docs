title: Database Migration
description: Step by step guide on how to approach Database migrations in Helm for LocalOps App Environments
---

In this guide, we demonstrate how DB migrations can be integrated into Helm charts in such a way that satisfies the principles for deploying schema migrations before starting the application. We will see how to handle both DB schema and data migrations.

<Important>
  We recommend using a robust migration framework for your applications that
  uses versioned migration files. Most migration frameworks support linear
  migrations, which only allow progressive changes. Therefore, if you need to
  remove a database column or field introduced in an earlier migration, you must
  create a new migration file specifically for this purpose. This approach
  ensures that all changes are tracked and applied in a controlled and
  sequential manner.
</Important>

## Prerequisites

1. A migrations docker image
2. A Helm chart defining your application.

## Schema Migrations

### Using Helm lifecycle hooks

To satisfy the principle of having migrations run before the new application version starts, as well as ensure that **only one migration job runs concurrently**, we use Helm's `pre-install` and `pre-upgrade` hooks feature.

<Info>
**Helm pre-upgrade hooks are chart hooks that:**

Executes on an upgrade request after templates are rendered, but before any resources are updated

</Info>

To use `pre-install` and `pre-upgrade` hooks to run migrations as part of our chart definition, we create a template for a **Kubernetes Job** and annotate it with the relevant Helm hook annotations.

<Info>
  Above Job will be run each time when an [App Environment] is created and when
  a deployment is made with a new helm chart version.

## Data Migrations

Similarly, DB data migrations can be performed within the same migration files and executed sequentially in a consistent order. This approach allows you to manage both schema and data changes together within the same migration framework, ensuring consistency and ease of development and maintenance.

<Tip>
  LocalOps intends to adopt Blue/Green deployment strategy soon. Therefore, it
  is advisable to avoid introducing breaking database or API changes in
  consecutive deployments. This practice ensures smoother transitions and
  minimizes disruptions during version upgrades.
