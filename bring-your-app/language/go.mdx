description: Learn how to deploy a Go application using LocalOps.
---

In this guide we will setup a basic Go HTTP server connected to a postgres database and deploy it using LocalOps.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you will need the following:

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [Docker] to build standalone containers to serve your Go app.

<Note>
  This guide assumes that you have basic knowledge of the above-mentioned
  technologies and tools. If you are not familiar with any of them, it is
  recommended to review their official documentation and tutorials to get up to
  speed before proceeding with this guide.
</Note>

## Go Http Server

1. Run the command `go mod init go-http-server` to set up your project and manage its dependencies.
2. Now, create a file named `main.go` and add the following code to set up a basic http server using the [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) web framework.

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

func main() {
	router := gin.Default()

	router.GET("/", func(c *gin.Context) {
		c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{
			"message": "Hello, World!",
		})
	})

	router.Run(":" + os.Getenv("APP_PORT")) // Default port 8080
}
```

3. Export the required environment variables,

```shell
export APP_PORT=8080
```

4. Run `go mod download` command to download the required dependencies.
5. Run the command `go run main.go` to start the server.

### Connect to your DB

1. Update the main.go file with the following code to connect your app to the database server

```go main.go
package main

import (
	"database/sql"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"

  _ "github.com/lib/pq"
	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

func main() {

  // Get the PostgreSQL connection details from environment variables
	dbHost := os.Getenv("DB_HOST")
	dbPort := os.Getenv("DB_PORT")
	dbUser := os.Getenv("DB_USER")
	dbPass := os.Getenv("DB_PASS")
	dbName := os.Getenv("DB_NAME")

	// Construct the connection string
	connStr := fmt.Sprintf("host=%s port=%s user=%s password=%s dbname=%s sslmode=disable", dbHost, dbPort, dbUser, dbPass, dbName)

	// Connect to the PostgreSQL database
	db, err := sql.Open("postgres", connStr)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Unable to connect to database: %v\n", err)
	}
	defer db.Close()

	router := gin.Default()

	router.GET("/", func(c *gin.Context) {
		c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{
			"message": "Hello, World!",
		})
	})

	router.Run(":" + os.Getenv("APP_PORT")) // Default port 8080
}
```

2. Export the required environment variables,

```shell
export APP_PORT=8080 \
  DB_HOST=localhost \
  DB_NAME=example-app-db \
  DB_USER=localops \
  DB_PASS=localops \
  DB_PORT=5432
```

3. Make sure you have already created the provided database with username and password.
4. Run the command `go run main.go` to start the server.

Visit `http://localhost:8080/` to see the response from the Go http server.

## Dockerize

Dockerizing makes the app run anywhere, agnostic of the platform. As long as Docker is installed, whether it's Windows, Mac, or Linux, it can run with the same behavior.

### Create [.dockerignore](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/context/#dockerignore-files)

Before creating the dockerfile, let's create a `.dockerignore` file and add that contents that should not be copied over to the docker file system.

```ignore .dockerignore
bin/
Dockerfile
.dockerignore
README.md
.git
```

Read more about [.dockerignore here](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/context/#dockerignore-files)

<Important>
  Creating a `.dockerinogre` file and adding folders like `node_modules` is
  must, since dependencies will be installed while building the image based on
  the platform preferences used. Copying those from file system will overwrite
  the installed dependecies and might error out during deployment
</Important>

### Create [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/)

Now, Create a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/). The Dockerfile is a text file that contains the instructions for Docker to build the image.

The Dockerfile is posted for reference with steps to create the production image. Though docker supports [Multi-Stage Builds](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/) we won't be using that here. In this example we will copy `source code` and build and run it inside the container. You can opt for multi stage build, if you want to build the go binary in build stage and run it in another stage.

<Tip>
  Refer to this [doc](https://docs.docker.com/language/golang/build-images/) to
  know more about building docker images for go applications.
</Tip>

```docker Dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
FROM golang:1.21

# Set destination for COPY
WORKDIR /app

# Download Go modules
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download

# Copy the source code.
COPY *.go ./

# Build
RUN GOOS=linux go build -o /go-http-server ./main.go

# Optional:
# To bind to a TCP port, runtime parameters must be supplied to the docker command.
# But we can document in the Dockerfile what ports
# the application is going to listen on by default.
# https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#expose
EXPOSE 8080

# Run
CMD ["/go-http-server"]

```

### Build docker image

Now you can build and run the Docker image. To build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t go-http-server .
```

This command builds the `go-http-server` image for platform `linux/amd64`.

If you are locally testing your application, you can skip the `platform` key to build the images

```bash
# only for testing in local machine
docker build -t go-http-server .
```

### Run the docker image

Let's run the Docker container using the image created of the react application with the command below.

```bash
docker run \
  -it \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e DB_HOST=localhost \
  -e DB_PORT=5432 \
  -e DB_NAME=example-app-db \
  -e DB_USER=localops \
  -e DB_PASS=localops \
  --name go-http-server \
  go-http-server
```

This command requires PostgresDB to be running on `localhost:5432`.
