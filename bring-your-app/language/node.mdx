description: Learn how to deploy a NodeJs application using LocalOps.
---

This documentation provides a step-by-step guide to setting up an HTTP server using [ExpressJs][express] and [NodeJs][node], and deploying it to LocalOps.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you will need the following:

- [Node.js][node] (v20.15.1 at the time of writing this doc).
- [npm] as a package manager for installing and maintaining dependencies. This usually comes bundled with Node.js.
- A foundational knowledge of [NodeJs][node] and [ExpressJs][express].
- [docker] to build standalone containers to serve your production app.

<Note>
  This guide assumes that you have a basic knowledge of the above-mentioned
  technologies and tools. If you are not familiar with any of them, it is highly
  recommended to review their official documentation and tutorials to get up to
  speed before proceeding with this guide.
</Note>

## Scaffolding the NodeJs app

Create a new folder for your Node.js project. In the following examples, we'll use the project name `node-project`.

```bash
mkdir <your project name>
cd <your project name>
```

Use the [npm init](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/commands/npm-init) command to create a `package.json` file for your application. For more information on how `package.json` works, see the specifics of [npmâ€™s package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/configuring-npm/package-json) handling. Run

```bash
npm init
```

and follow the prompts for various settings, such as the name (`<your project name>`) and version of your application. For now, you can simply hit RETURN to accept the defaults for most of them, with the following exception:

```sh
entry point: (index.js)
```

Enter `app.js`, or whatever you want the name of the main file to be. If you want it to be `index.js`, hit RETURN to accept the suggested default file name.

### Installing Express.js

At this point, you have a Node.js project ready. Let's install Express and save it in the dependency list by running

```bash
npm install express
```

<Note>
  At the time of writing this guide, the latest `express` version is 4.19.2.
</Note>

If you have more questions, check out the [Node.js guide](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/introduction-to-nodejs) and [Express.js guide](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) to learn more about scaffolding the app.

You can also use tools like [express-generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html) to quickly scaffold your app. Note: While writing this guide, the express-generator is not very well maintained and has known issues with tools provided out of the box; hence, it is recommended to use a manual setup, which is also straightforward.

### Hello World! example

Create a file called `app.js` as mentioned earlier for the entry point and write a simple Express app that returns `Hello World!` when navigating to the `/` path of the URL.

```js app.js
const express = require('express'); // import the express dependency

const app = express(); // create the app
// Look for port from the environment variables.
// or use the fallback port
const port = process.env.PORT ?? 3500;

// Create a route to handle `/` and return `Hello World!` in the response.
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

// Start the HTTP router on the given port.
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`);
});

// Handle the exit signal and quit the process.
process.on('SIGINT', function () {
  process.exit();
});
```

All of your dependencies should be installed at this point (which you can verify by checking for the existence of a `node_modules` folder in your project), so you can start your project by running the command:

```bash
node app.js
```

If everything is successful, you should see a similar confirmation message in your terminal:

```
Example app listening on port 3500
```

Open `http://localhost:3500` in your browser of choice. You should see the Node.js app running and printing `Hello World!` in the document.

## Create the Docker image

Dockerizing makes the app run anywhere, agnostic of the platform. As long as Docker is installed, whether it's Windows, Mac, or Linux, it can run with the same behavior.

Before creating the Dockerfile, let's create a `.dockerignore` file and add the contents that should not be copied over to the Docker file system.

```ignore .dockerignore
Dockerfile
.dockerignore
node_modules
npm-debug.log
README.md
.git
```

Read more about [.dockerignore here](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/context/#dockerignore-files).

<Important>
  Creating a `.dockerignore` file and adding folders like `node_modules` is a
  must since dependencies will be installed while building the image based on
  the platform preferences used. Copying those from the file system will
  overwrite the installed dependencies and might error out during deployment.
</Important>

Now, create a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/). The Dockerfile is a text file that contains the instructions for Docker to build the image.

The Dockerfile is posted for reference with steps to create the production image. Though Docker supports [Multi-Stage Builds](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/), we won't be using that here since Node.js needs all the `source code` and `node_modules` to be present while running the application. You can opt for multi-stage builds if your process fits that approach.

```docker Dockerfile
# Use nodejs v20 alpine image
FROM node:20-alpine

# Switch to the app directory,
# This will be our app's root directory inside the container.
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the manifest and lock file to the root.
# Note: ./ refers to /app, since we switched context in the above step.
COPY package.json package-lock.json* ./

# Set the NODE_ENV to production.
# to configure the application to build/run under production mode
# this also tells npm to not install devDependencies mentioned in package.json
# as we won't be needing that to run our app
ENV NODE_ENV=production

# Install the production dependencies
RUN npm ci

# Copy all the files from our machine to the container
COPY . .

# The port you'd like to use for Nginx
ENV PORT=3500

# Expose the port the Nginx is running to the outside world
EXPOSE ${PORT}

# Start the node server
ENTRYPOINT ["node","./app.js"]
```

Now you can build and run the Docker image. To build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t node-app:latest .
```

This command builds the `node-app` image for platform `linux/amd64` and tags it as `latest`.

If you are locally testing your application, you can skip the `platform` key to build the images

```bash
# only for testing on local machine
docker build -t node-app:latest .
```

## Run the Docker image

Let's run the Docker container using the image created of the Node application with the command below.

```bash
docker run \
  -it \
  --rm \
  --name node-app \
  -e PORT=3500 \
  -d \
  -p 3500:3500 \
  node-app
```

- `-it`: enables interactivity with TTY.
- `--rm`: tells the Docker Daemon to clean up the container and remove the file system after the container exits.
- `--name node-app`: Name of the container `node-app`.
- `-e PORT=3500`: Sets the environment variable PORT in Docker to `3500`.
- `-d`: Runs the container in detached (background) mode. You can skip the flag to see the logs directly in your terminal window.
- `-p 3500:3500`: Maps port 3500 on your host to port 3500 in the container.
- `node-app` at the end is the name of the image.

After running the command, visit `http://localhost:3500` to see the Node.js application running inside the Docker container.

Hurray ðŸŽ‰! Now we have created and packaged a Node app for production use.
