Publishing a Helm package to an AWS ECR _(Elastic Container Registry)_ private repository involves several steps:

1. [Package the Helm chart](/bring-your-app/first-steps/have-docker#package-a-helm-chart)
2. [Create an ECR private repository](#2-create-an-ecr-private-repository)
3. [Authenticate Helm to your ECR private registry](#3-authenticate-helm-to-your-ecr-private-registry)
4. [Push the Helm chart to ECR private registry](#4-push-the-helm-chart-to-ecr-private-registry)

### 1. Package as Helm chart

To package as helm chart please refer [this article](/bring-your-app/first-steps/have-docker#package-a-helm-chart).

### 2. Create an ECR private repository

1. Login to [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com).
2. Go to [ECR console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr).
3. Switch to the preferred AWS region where you want to create the ECR private repository.
4. Create a private repository,
   1. In the left navigation pane, click on [**Private registry -> Repositories**](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/private-registry/repositories).
   2. Click on the **Create repository** button.
   3. Fill in repository name field.<br />Repository name must be same as Helm chart name. You can find your Helm chart name in **Chart.yaml -> name**.
   4. Click on **Create repository** button.

### 3. Authenticate Helm to your ECR private registry

<Note>

1. Below steps require the **AWS CLI** to be installed and setup with required credentials. If it is not already installed, please refer to [this article](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html#getting-started-install-instructions) for installation instructions.
2. Below steps require the **Helm CLI** to be installed. If it is not already installed, please refer to [this article](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) for installation instructions.

</Note>

- Login to ECR private helm registry,
  ```shell
  aws ecr get-login-password \
       --region <aws_region> | helm registry login \
       --username AWS \
       --password-stdin <aws_account_no>.dkr.ecr.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com
  ```
  Above command should output,
  ```shell
  Login Succeeded
  ```

### 4. Push the Helm chart to ECR private registry

- Below command will push the packaged helm chart to your ECR private registry,
  ```shell
  helm push <chart_name>-<chart_version>.tgz oci://<aws_acc_no>.dkr.ecr.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com/
  ```
- You can optionally verify the Helm push by navigating to your [**ECR -> Private registry -> Repositories**](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/private-registry/repositories) in your AWS console.
