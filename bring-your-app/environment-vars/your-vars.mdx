title: Your Variables
---

You can dynamically configure your application by passing environment variables to the container hosting your application image by adding them to the pod template specification in your Helm chart.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: acme-api-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: acme-api
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: acme-api
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: api-container
          image: public.ecr.aws/ach42q1u/acme-api:1.0.0
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
          env:
            - name: APP_PORT
              value: 8080
            - name: DB_USER
              value: '{{ .Values.db.user }}'
            - name: DB_PASS
              value: '{{ .Values.db.pass }}'
            - name: DB_HOST
              value: '{{ .Values.db.host }}'
            - name: DB_PORT
              value: '{{ .Values.db.port }}'
```

You can set the values for these environment variables directly, such as APP_PORT from this example.

You can also use Helm values to customize your application's configuration for each environment you wish to create.

```yaml
db:
  host: postgres-service
  user: postgres
  pass: postgres
  port: 5432
```

The environment variables `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`, `DB_HOST` and `DB_PORT` are set dynamically during each deployment.
