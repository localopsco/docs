Awesome! You have everything you need to get your deployments running.

Next step is to publish your helm chart. Checkout [this guide](bring-your-app/publish-helm-chart/ecr.md) to publish your Helm chart to Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry).

<Info>
  LocalOps currently can access Helm charts stored in Amazon ECR. Support for
  other registries will be coming soon.
</Info>

Once you finish publishing your Helm chart, follow these steps:

1. Create an [App](https://help.localops.co/en/articles/9580323-apps)
2. Create a [Release](https://help.localops.co/en/articles/9582027-releases) for each version of your Helm chart that you wish to deploy.
3. Create a [Cloud Connection](/connecting-cloud/aws) to the target cloud account's where you would like to create your app environments.
4. Select the desired connection, specific application, release version, and the environment template to be applied and proceed to create an [App environment](https://help.localops.co/en/articles/9582075-app-environments).

That's it. From here onwards, you can start [making new releases and deployments](/make-releases) as required on the app environment.
