description: Step-by-step guide to add Redis to your Helm chart for Kubernetes applications
---

This guide will walk you through the steps to integrate Redis into your existing Helm chart for your Kubernetes application. By adding Redis, you can leverage its capabilities for caching, session management, and more. We will use the Bitnami Redis Helm chart as a dependency and configure it accordingly.

## Prerequisites

- Helm installed and configured
- Kubernetes cluster up and running
- Existing Helm chart for your application

## Steps to Integrate Redis

### 1. Add Redis Helm Repository

First, add the Bitnami repository, which hosts the Redis Helm chart,

```sh
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo update
```

### 2. Update `Chart.yaml`

Open your existing Helm chart directory and edit the `Chart.yaml` file to add Redis as a dependency,

```yaml Chart.yaml
apiVersion: v2
name: your-app
description: A Helm chart for your Kubernetes application
version: 0.1.0
appVersion: '1.0'

dependencies:
  - name: redis
    version: 17.0.1
    repository: https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
```

### 3. Update `values.yaml`

Create or update the values.yaml file to include configuration values for Redis. Customize the values as per your requirements.

```yaml values.yaml
redis:
  enabled: true
  auth:
    password: myredispassword
  architecture: standalone
  master:
    persistence:
      enabled: true
      size: 8Gi
```

### 4. Install/Update Dependencies

Navigate to your Helm chart directory and run the following command to update dependencies,

```shell
helm dependency update
```

This command will download the Redis chart and add it to your charts/ directory.

### 5. Update Your Application Deployment

Modify your applicationâ€™s deployment files to include the Redis service. Ensure your application can connect to Redis using the service name and credentials specified in the `values.yaml` file.

For example, if using a ConfigMap to store environment variables for your application, you might update it like this,

```yaml templates/configmap.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: your-app-config
data:
  REDIS_HOST: 'your-app-redis-master'
  REDIS_PORT: '6379'
  REDIS_PASSWORD: 'myredispassword'
```

### 6. Deploy Your Application

Finally, deploy or upgrade your application using Helm,

```shell
helm install your-app ./your-app-chart
# or if upgrading an existing release
helm upgrade your-app ./your-app-chart
```

### 7. Verify Deployment

Check the status of your Helm release to ensure everything is running correctly,

```shell
helm status your-app
```

Also, verify that the Redis pod is running:

```shell
kubectl get pods
```

You should see a pod for Redis, something like `your-app-redis-master-0`.

Congratulations! You have successfully added Redis to your existing Helm chart. This integration allows your application to use Redis for caching, session management, and other use cases, managed efficiently with Helm. Customize the Redis configuration further by modifying the `values.yaml` file as needed. ðŸŽ‰
